<link-summary>How to install Anchor Chain-based mods</link-summary>

# Installing Mods

## Installing Steam Workshop Mods

AnchorChain was made to make installing mods from the Steam Workshop as simple as possible. 
Simply subscribe to the mod you would like to use, and it should be loaded by Anchor Chain.

## Installing Manually-Installed Mods

Ideally, any manually-installed mod should provide its own guidance for installation.
If this is not the case, we can only provide general guidance on how to get Anchor Chain to load it.

Anchor Chain will look for mods in a few places, but the simplest place is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sea Power\Sea Power_Data\StreamingAssets`.
To get Anchor Chain to load a mod, all the mod's files must be **within a folder** in that directory.
