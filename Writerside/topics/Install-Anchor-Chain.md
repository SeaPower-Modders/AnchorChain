# Installing Anchor Chain

<note>
Installing Anchor Chain is made to be as simple as possible, but it still requires an understanding of how to use your computer.
If you do not know how to navigate your file system or download, unzip, and move files and folders, please ask someone to help you out.
</note>

## Installing the Anchor Chain Preloader

<tip>
Anchor Chain is based upon the free and open source Unity mod loader, 
<a href="https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/index.html" summary="Official BepInEx documentation">BepInEx</a>.
Anchor Chain's preloader includes BepInEx to make installation easier, but a manual installation BepInEx of version 5.4.x.x should work.
</tip>

<procedure title="How To Install the Anchor Chain Preloader">
<step>
Go to the <a href="https://github.com/SeaPower-Modders/AnchorChain">Anchor Chain github page</a> and download the <code>ACPreloader.zip</code> file from the most recent release.
You can find the most recent release in the right hand sidebar underneath "Releases".
</step>
<step>
Unzip <code>ACPreloader.zip</code> into a folder within your Downloads folder.
</step>
<step>
Find the <code>winhttp.dll</code> file within the unzipped folder, and use <shortcut key="$Copy"/> or <shortcut key="$Cut"/> to copy or cut everything within that folder.
</step>
<step>
Navigate to your Sea Power installation.
It should be located under <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sea Power\</code>.
</step>
<step>
Press <shortcut key="$Paste"/> to paste the Anchor Chain Preloader into your Sea Power game.
</step>
<step>
Ensure that you see the <code>BepInEx</code>, <code>winhttp.dll</code>, and <code>doorstop_config.ini</code> files in your Sea Power folder.
</step>

You have now installed the Anchor Chain Preloader! 
This is what allows us to distribute the bulk of Anchor Chain via the Steam Workshop.
